## Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to [endormi](https://github.com/endormi) of course for inspiring me to make this, and to everyone who helped me out with CSS stuff in the Powercord server, most notably the following people:

- [LuckFire](https://github.com/LuckFire/) for their incredible [Midnight Mars theme](https://github.com/LuckFire/midnight-mars) and for all the time and help they've given me :]
- [Doggybootsy](https://github.com/doggybootsy) and [void](https://github.com/voidfill) for their useful tidbits of advice, extensive CSS knowledge and help with fixing various things :)
- [emma ðŸŒº](https://github.com/ghostlydilemma) for explaining how inline CSS has a higher specificity than sheet/embedded CSS and for always being so kind ^-^
- [katlyn](https://github.com/katlyn) for telling me just how bad `!important` is and general helpful advice :>

Thank you to my mum for helping me choose the right colours and styles (she has a keen eye for that).<br>
